# homebrew-brewfile

## Why
This is a boilerplate brewfile I use when setting up a new Mac (or Refreshing an existing one.)

## How to use
fork into your own github account, then either use with the excellent [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap "A script to bootstrap a minimal macOS development system.") from Mike McQuaid, **or** cloning locally and running it with: `brew bundle [install] --file <location of Brewfile>`.

## Create your own
running `brew bundle dump` will create a Brewfile in the current working directory

## Other Usage
See [the `brew bundle` section of the `brew man` output](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#bundle-subcommand) or `brew bundle --help`.
